> waynee95's Plugin Collection for RPG Maker MV 

I develop my plugins using ES6 (ECMAScript 6) and the transpile them with Babel to ES5 (ECMAScript 5). <br>
In this repo you find two folders:
- `src` contains the actual source code
- `dist` contains the compiled files 

## How to download
- Go to the `dist` folder
- Click on the plugin, you want to download
- Right-click on `raw`
- Then `save as`
- Make sure that you save it as a `.js` file

## Terms of Use
